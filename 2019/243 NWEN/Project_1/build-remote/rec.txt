HI THERE, I WAS REALLY HOPING THAT WE COULD POSTPONE THE RAID. I REALLY WANT TO SEE THE ALIENS BUT I HAVE TO TAKE MY CAT TO THE VET ON 
SEPTEMBER 20. I JUST REALLY HOPE THE GOVERNMENT ISN'T FORCED TO SPEND INCREASING AMOUNTS OF MONEY ON DEFENSE WHILE WE KEEP POSTPONING. 
MAYBE POSTPONING WILL GIVE US MORE TIME TO PLAN OUR ALIEN PARTIES! POSTPONING COULD EVEN GIVE MORE TIME FOR MORE PEOPLE TO SIGN UP, 
WHILE WE TAKE OUR TIME TO FIGURE OUT A DAY THAT BETTER WORKS FOR EVERYONE, BUT LETS KEEP UP THE PLANNING PLEASE!
