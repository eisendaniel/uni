1.	You can speed up the testing process by; increasing the tick speed or
	maybe more useful, setting the initial time value as the see all the
	and verifiying the recycling [of h,m,s]. I.e to 23:59:59.

2.	We could not get a reliable oscilloscope ouput, but as this program uses the polling approuch and as the increment subroutine
	has a differing run length depending on if its overflowing or not, the exact timer will vary.

3.	As value used within the program are hexideciaml to set the intial 
	display to 23:59:59
	MOV	R1,#58H		//seconds
	MOV	R2,#59H		//minutes
	MOV	R3,#23H		//hours
