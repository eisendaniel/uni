NWEN Assignment 2


Part I: Pointer Concepts 
Task 1. 
1.  
    float f = 3.142;
    float *fp = &f;


2.  
    long* func1(int, int);


3.  
    char* func2(const char*); 


4.  
    int* ipa[20];


5.  
    char strings[][10] = {"cyan", "magenta", "yellow", "black"};


Task 2. 
1. &u  (i.e the numeric value of the memory address) is 1100
2. &v  (i.e the numeric value of the memory address) is 1101
3. After line 2 the pointer pv is now assigned to address 1101
4. *pv is now 66, i.e the ascii decimal value of 'B'
5. u is now 'C'


Task 3.
1.  
    [Output]
    57  80
    80  80


2. Printing int1 outputs 57 as the last line is 
    int1 = 57
  Printing int2 outputs 80 as int1Ptr is set to the pointer variable referencing int2, so both pointers intPtr1 and 2 point to int2. Then intPtr1 is dereferenced and set to 80, ie seting the value of int2 to 80
    int1Ptr = int2Ptr; //int1Ptr now points to int2
    *int1Ptr = 80; //thus int2 is now 80



Task 4.
1. numeric value of a (decimal address of stored data) is 1102
2. numeric value of ppa (decimal address of pointed to variable pa) is 1114
3. *ppa (pa) + 2 is 1118. i.e *ppa + 2(2 bytes)


Task 5.
1.  
    for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(strPtr); i++) {
            std::cout << *strPtr << std::endl; //outputs the derefances value of strPtr
            strPtr++; //increments strPtr by a 1 string size
    }
2.  
    delete[] strPtr;
