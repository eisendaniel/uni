Task 1

1)
    a) Nope, while is a protected term
    b) Yes
    c) No, as it starts with a symbol
    d) No, - is not allowed in names

2) 
    a) 15
    b) 2
    c) 1
    d) 1

3)
    a) 183
    b) 3
    c) 156
    d) 2652

Task 2

1) According to the graph in the first lecture, it would end up turning into an long,
following the Conversion Hierachy

2) This is a simple boolean expression basically saying that if j > 5 then i else j.
    For this one j is greater than 5, so i gets returned. 8 in this case.

3) We are providing an int with a double. Even if it compiles, we will lose the decimal part.
Depends on the goal of the code whether that is important or not

4)
int main (void) {
    for (int j = 5; j >= 0; --j)
    {
        printf("%d ");
    }

    return 0;
}

Task 3

1)
i=5
j=10
k=1

k+= 3*--i

--i = 4
3 * 4 = 12
1 += 12

i = 4
j = 10
k = 13

13 - j++
13 - 10

i = 4
j = 11
k = 3

2)
Looking at the documentation for strlen(), it says it does not count the null \0 character.
This means that the total length will be 11
