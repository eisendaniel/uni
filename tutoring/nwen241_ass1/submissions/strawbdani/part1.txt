1)
A)invalid
B)valid
C)invalid
D)invalid

2)
A)7+3+5=15
B)7/3=2
C)1
D)1

3)
A)183
B)3
C)156
D)2652 


Completion

1)
It will be type "long" due to the conversion hierarchy

2)
The statement k = (j > 5) ? i : j; means if j(6) is greater than 5 it will assign k to i(8) then since this is true k = 8 

3)
The problem is that 10.0 is not an int it is a double, and we cannot use double in an int calculation plus modulus requires an int not a double 

4)
int main (void){
	
	int j;
	for (j=4 ; j>=-1 ; --j){
	
		printf("%d ", j );
	

	}

 return 0;
}


Challenge

1)
--i so i = 4
3 * 4 = 12
k = 1(k) + 12 = 13 
j = j + 1
j = 11

2) 

strlen() calculates the length of a string, it doesn't count the null character \0 or anything after while calculating the length. so it will print 3
