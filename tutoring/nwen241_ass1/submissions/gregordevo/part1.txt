Task One:
1. 
   a. Invalid
   b. Valid
   c. Invalid
   d. Valid 2. 
   a. 15   b. 2
   c. 1
   d. 1 3.       
   a. 183
   b. 3
   c. 156
   d. 2652


Task Two:
      1.  Char + int + long would result in the answer being a long because of the type hierarchy. if the long was initialised to 1.4 then the answer could not be accurately represented if it was an int or char type.

      2. k = 8, the expression:
k = (j > 5) ? i : j
Is essentially an if else statement saying :
If (j > 5) {k = i;}
else{k = j;}

      3. Because the entire expression is being changed to a double then modulus operand canâ€™t be used. 

      4. for(int j = 4; j >= -1; j--){
        printf("%d ",j);  
}
Task Three:
         1. int i = 5, j = 10, k = 1;
(k += 3*--i) - j++; == (k += (3 * 4) ) -j++
(1 += 12) - 10++
k = 13, i = 4, j = 11


            2. Because the words in the character array string[] are seperated by the ASCII character for NULL, when the strlen() function is counting the chars, it finds the NULL object in the data and assumes that its the end of the array and stops counting.
