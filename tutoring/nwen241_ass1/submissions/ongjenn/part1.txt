Completion
1) long - This is because char will be implicitly converted to an int. (c+1) which is an int will be casted to a long, making (c + i + 1) a long. This is so that no significance is lost during evaluation.

2) 8. This is short-form for 
if(j>5)
	k = i;
else 
	k = j;
Therefore k is set to i which is 8.

3) 10.0 / 4 is evaluated first: 4 is casted to a double, making (10.0/4) of the double type. The program then tries to use the modulo operand on a double and int (ie. 2 is an int, so (double % int)). This is a problem as % only accepts integers.

4) int main (void) {
	for (int j = 4; j >= -1; j--) 
		printf(“%d ”, j);
	return 0;
   }

Challenge
1) Steps:
a) Parenthesis:
	- the ‘--‘ operator is done first. i is decremented from 5 to 4
	- then the ‘*’ operator is next.  (k += 3*4) becomes (k += 12)
	- lastly the +=: This means k is incremented by 12. k now equals 13
b) 
	- firstly the ‘j++’. j is returned and then incremented by 1. This means j is now 11
	
In short: i = 4, j = 11, k = 13

2) This will print out the integer 3. This is because a string in c is defined as the sequence of characters in a character array until a null terminator is reached. The strlen function counts the number or elements in the char array until the first occurrence of '\0' (null terminator). If we were to print out the string, only "One" would be printed.
