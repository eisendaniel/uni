Task1 - Core[20 Marks]:
1) 
    a) invalid
    b) valid
    c) invalid
    d) valid
2)
    a) 15
    b) 2
    c) 1
    d) 1
3)
    a) 183
    b) 3
    c) 156
    d) 2652

Task2 - Comp[8 Marks]:
1) the expression is long type, 
because it takes on the largest sized character type of the expression to store the 
info so all of the numbers info is kept without losing anything due to smaller size.

2) 8
The statement (j > 5) is acting like an if statement, if true return i. else return j

3) The number "10.0" is using a double format in an equation returning an int.
This would fail as the double isn't converted into an int, as 10.0/2 != 5 BUT 5.0.

4) 
int main()
{
    for(int j = 4; j >= -1; j--)
        printf("%d ", j);
    return 0;
}

Task3 - Chal[5 Marks]:
1) i=4, j=11, k=13
* --i (i=5 -> i=4)
* k += 3*4 (k=1 -> k=13)
* j++ (j=10 -> j=11)

2) the answer is 3. After the initial \0 value indicates the end of the string
the string length function identifies the length of the string as the first 3 chars
"O", "n" and "e" as the whole string length.
