TASK 2
1   long, because the long type has the highest conversion rank out of the 3 types, so the expression assumes the type of the greatest conversion rank.
2   8, because j=6 is greater than 5, so the ternary operator chooses i, as it is on the 'value if true' side of ":"
3   the remainder (%) operator cannot compute result between a double type (10.0/4) and an int type (2)
    
4   int main(void) {
        for(int j = 4; j >= -1; j--){
            printf("%d ", j);

TASK 3
1   step 1: 3*--5           i = 4
    step 2: 3*4
    step 3: k = 1 + 12      k = 13
    step 4: (13) - 10++     j = 11
    Step 5: 13 - 11
    Answer: 2

2   The output is 3 because the "\0" is a null character (null terminator) and represents the end of a
    character array (string) so the strlen function is reading the character array "string" until the
    first "\0" (char \0 is not included in result)
