Task 1.

1)
a: Valid
b: Valid
c: Invalid
d: Invalid

2)
a: 15
b: 2
c: 1
d: 1

3)
a: 183
b: --
c: 2652
d: --


Task 2.

1)
The data type of c+i+l will be an int. This is because the data type of each value corresponds to an integer value, as such adding the values together will return an integer value.

2)
The value assigned to k will be 8. This is because the expression (j > 5) returns true, and as such the experssion (i) is assigned to k. If the experssion (j > 5) returned false, then j would be assigned to k.

3)
The problem with this statement is "rem" is being initialised as int, however the equation uses both integers and double values in its experession.

4)
int main(void) {
	
	for (int i = 4; i >= -1; i--)
		printf("%d ", i); 

	return 0;
}


Task 3.

1) 
i = 4
j = 11
k = 13

Steps:

1: (k += 3*--i) - j++
2: (k += 3*4) - j++ 	-> 	(i = 4)
4: (k += 12) - j++
5:  13 - j++ 			-> 	(k = 13)
6:	13 - 11 			->  (j = 11)

2)
strlen(string) will equal 3.

This is because the strlen function will count the letters of the string "one", before reaction \0, which indicates the end of a string, and as such strlen will stop counting when it gets to \0, resulting in a count of 3
