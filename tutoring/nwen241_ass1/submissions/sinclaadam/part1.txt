NWEN 241 Part 1:

Task 1
1.  a) - invalid
    b) - valid
    c) - invalid
    d) - invalid

2.  a) 15
    b) 2
    c) 1
    d) 1

3.  a) 183
    b) 3
    c) 156
    d) 2652

Task 2
1.  The expression will be of type long due to implicit typ conversion using
    the conversion hierarchy

2.  k is assigned the value of i which is 8. The second line is a shorthand if
    statement where if j > 5 k = i, else k = j;

3.  The 10.0 / 4 is evaluated first which is converted to a floating point
    number, and the modulus operator requires 2 integer types to work.

4.  for (int j = 4; j >=-1; j--) {
        printf("%d ", j);
        }

Task 3
1.  final values i = 4, j = 11, k = 13
    because it is not stored in a variable it evaluates the variables

int i = 5, j = 10, k = 1;
    (k += 3*--i) - j++;
    STEPS
    (k = k + 3*--i) - 10
    (k = 1 + 12) - 10
    (k = 13) - 10
    k = 13

2. output is 3 

because the strlen function returns the length up to the null character '\0' which occurs after "One" hence it will be of length 3
