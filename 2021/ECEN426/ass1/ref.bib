  abstract = {The Faculty of Engineering at Victoria University of
Wellington has constructed a robotic bass guitar player, Bassbot.
A critical feature of such a robot is the plucking mechanism.
Three mechanisms were made, two using stepper motors of
differing sizes and one using two pull type solenoids. These were
compared based on metrics of speed and consistency. There was
trade-offs between the systems, with the most consistent being the
slowest and the fastest system being the least consistent. To
expand the abilities of the robot, a height adjusting cam was
added to one of the stepper motors to allow dynamic playing.},
