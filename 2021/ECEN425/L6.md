# Design Process

What is the problem??

Stop making assumptions about a client that you don't know yet.

All clients/bosses are different. They will engage/promote with ideas in different ways. 

* Could be technical correctness
* Could be based on team repour

Would you buy this?

## Assignment 2

Timeline is variable with client.

Keep client engaged, so progress, don't waste time. 

(Understand client vision, build repour) -> (General Idea feedback) -> (3 onwards: Final confirmations and airing out confusions etc)

### Expectation

Team members - Talk in presentations, technical report of assigned tasks

Team Lead - Management report, gory details

# Ethics in Engineering (Workplace)

Duel purpose development is a fine line.

Collaboration partners must be considered
