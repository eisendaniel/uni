    "Welcome to your first ENGR222 computer lab.\n",
    "The aim of this lab is to introduce you to Python3 and some of the modules you will use throughout this course.\n",
    "Python is an extremely flexible and extensible programming language that can be used for almost any concievable purpose.\n",
    "The focus of these lab sessions will be using Python for scientific computing, it is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to programming in Python.\n",
    "There are three modules that will be used throughout the lab sessions, numpy, scipy and matplotlib.\n",
    "Additionally, you are currently reading this within a jupyter notebook via the jupyter module.\n",
    "Jupyter is a great tool that will allow us to program with python in an interactive and dynamic manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: this particular cell is a *markdown* cell, as opposed to a code cell, which allows me to write nicely formatted text. It is very useful for me to use when writing up these tutorial notes but it is not something that you, the student, need to be familiar with. \n",
    "You will use and interact with *code* cells, which are the default cell type within jupyter notebooks."

    "Some more bits are used to represent the exponent (an integer expressed in base 2). \n",
    "Remaining bits *approximate* the mantissa (in a binary representation).\n",
